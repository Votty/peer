# Votty Peer
For now, only `run` function works. For `install` and `update` function, refer our another temporary repository, `net`. Or listen [SLAV KING](https://youtu.be/u4kdkz6EF-A) for waiting and keeping calm of your mind.

## Requirements
One of our components, `fabric-shim` package, does not support bleeding-edge version of softwares. So you may use some old environment.  
+ **Node.js `v8.9.0 or later, but lower than v9.0.0`**

## How to run
```sh
$ yarn # (or npm)
$ ./vpeer
```
